## Install

Clone this repo

Run

`npm install`

To start the bot, run

`token=<MY TOKEN> node slack_bot.js`

## Pongbot understands:

* "won", "last", "lost" - fetches the last game played from /api/v1/games and shows who won and lost

* "most points", "leaderboard", "top", "points" - fetches the (already sorted) list of players from /api/v1/players

* more to come
